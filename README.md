# Food Prediction.
### Description:
Machine-learning approach for automated and systematic prediction of nutrient content available in food.
### Installation instructions:
```js
git clone https://github.com/AhmedAl-Sardi/CS392-Workshop02-Group3.git
cd CS392-Workshop02-Group3
git submodule update --init
docker-compose up 
npm install
npm run start
```
### Operating instructions:
Write any kind of food ingredients on the text field and press submit then the result will appear on a text area. For example, If we write beef, tomato, and bread it will return a burger. For clearing the text there is a button that will clear all the fields and you will be ready to write again. The text area which is going to be for viewing is going to be dynamically changing.
